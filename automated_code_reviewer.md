# Automated Code Review System

## Overview
A system that automatically analyzes code changes and provides immediate feedback after each commit, without requiring a formal pull request. The system combines pattern-based analysis with AI-powered insights to provide comprehensive code review feedback.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Commit Analysis
- Webhook-based system that triggers on each commit
- Immediate feedback without manual intervention
- Analysis of code changes using predefined patterns

### 2. Refactoring Pattern Detection
- Static to instance variable conversions
- New class extractions
- Interface creation
- Dependency injection patterns
- Code smell identification
- Test coverage changes

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis
- Integration with Claude AI for deeper code analysis
- Context-aware suggestions based on commit history
- Identification of improvement opportunities
- Alternative approach suggestions

### 4. Automated Feedback
- Detailed commit comments with findings
- Suggestions for next steps
- Option to create issue tickets automatically
- Code snippet suggestions
- Historical pattern tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **GitHub Webhook Handler**
   - Receives push events from GitHub
   - Validates webhook signatures
   - Extracts commit information

2. **Pattern Analyzer**
   - Regular expression-based pattern matching
   - Predefined refactoring patterns
   - Extensible pattern library

3. **AI Integration**
   - Claude API integration
   - Context preparation
   - Response processing

4. **Feedback Generator**
   - Markdown comment generation
   - GitHub API integration
   - Issue creation capabilities

### Technology Stack
- Python Flask for webhook server
- GitHub API for repository interaction
- Anthropic API for AI analysis
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- HMAC for webhook security

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: GitHub webhook secret
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API key
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token

### GitHub Configuration
1. Repository webhook setup
2. Appropriate permissions for comment creation
3. API access configuration

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Create webhook endpoint
2. Implement security validation
3. Basic commit analysis

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
1. Implement pattern detector
2. Define initial pattern set
3. Add pattern matching logic

### Phase 3: AI Integration
1. Set up Claude API integration
2. Define analysis prompts
3. Process AI responses

### Phase 4: Feedback System
1. Implement comment generation
2. Add issue creation
3. Set up suggestion system

## Usage Example

### Sample Commit Flow
1. Developer makes a commit
2. Webhook receives push event
3. System analyzes changes
4. Feedback is posted as commit comment

### Sample Feedback Format
```markdown
## Refactoring Review ðŸ”„
